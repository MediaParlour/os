# MediaPlay OS
*This is my side-project for now as I have lots of things to do.*

## What's with this new version?
No WebGL (most of the time). Currently there's no proper boot screen and dock yet.

## Will it work on mobile?
Not really, as it's focused for the desktop web for now.

## How's the versioning?
It follows the rolling release model: no releases, just little updates (and yes, that means it can break at any time)

## Any cloud data storing feature?
Maybe... If you *really* want a cloud data storing feature, let me know about it in the Dicussions section!

## Nothing else?
Nothing else... for now.
