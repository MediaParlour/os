This is Linerly's iteration of MediaPlay OS, created using [Scratch](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/index.html?width=1366&height=768&username=Guest&fps=60&load_griffpatch=false).

Source files (*.sb3) will be in /source.

The web version converted from the sb3 file does has some problems, but these will be fixed after a while.

## Some tools that I used
- [TurboWarp Packager](https://packager.turbowarp.org)
- [Eç¾Šicques](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/) - A Scratch mod with a custom aspect ratio that can load an extension from a URL, although this might be replaced with TurboWarp's desktop app soon as it sometimes break things

# MediaPlay OS
Not an actual OS, but we're doing it just for fun!

It has several versions of it, one made in Scratch by Linerly in the `linerly` branch, and [one made using PowerPoint by Linerly as well in the `main` branch](https://github.com/MediaPlay-Discord/os/)

This branch is also used for deploying it to https://mediaplay-discord.github.io/os

## Okay, but will it be an actual OS in the future?
We're not sure about it, but let's see what we will decide later.

## Techy already made MPD OS and it's fine! Why bother making a 'remastered' version?
This remastered version will include more features, including a polished installation wizard,  new UIs, more functionalites, and more to come!

## Can I help?
Although it's being worked on by 3 people - UN4YA, Dimitris Savu, and Linerly - you could help by making new assets and UI designs!

## Why bother using PowerPoint? It's proprietary.
We know about this. One of us had an idea in mind to make it in Scratch - which technically has a lot more features than PowerPoint - but most of us can use PowerPoint or any other program (like LibreOffice Impress, which Linerly uses it) anyway.

## Can I submit ideas?
You can submit by going to the Issues section of this repository, thanks!

## What's with MediaPlay OS and MPD OS?
We've decided to change the name of the project since we're not affiliated with Discord or anything.
