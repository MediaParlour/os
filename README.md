This is Linerly's iteration of MediaPlay OS, created using [Scratch](https://sheeptester.github.io/scratch-gui/index.html?width=1366&height=768&username=Guest&fps=60&load_griffpatch=false).

Source files (*.sb3) will be in /source.

The web version converted from the sb3 file does has some problems, but these will be fixed after a while.

## Tools

- [TurboWarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/)

## Design
In my MediaPlay OS iteration, the design is somewhat similar to Android, but without the top/status bar - instead the dock (and the drawer - lists of apps and a search section - below) is where you can find everything you need.

Due to the limitations and complexity in Scratch, the app's window will fill the whole screen, only has a close button, and with the dock handle visible but not blocking some of the things in the apps.

## Imagined Apps with Concepts/Mockups
*Not real; not actual functioning apps; it's simulated. When it gets actually made in Scratch, there will be 'errors' if you try to do something that the apps can't do due to the app's database of [something - websites, users, whatever, it will take a while to get those sources and update them regularly, but it's a small project anyway] - it's intentional.*
- WebPlay (web browser)
- Chedia (a portmanteau of 'chat' and 'media'; a Matrix client)
...

You can find the concepts/mockups for the apps in https://github.com/MediaPlay-Discord/os/tree/linerly/extras/concepts.

# MediaPlay OS
Not an actual OS, but we're doing it just for fun!

It has several versions of it, one made in Scratch by Linerly in the `linerly` branch, and [one made using PowerPoint by Linerly as well in the `main` branch](https://github.com/MediaPlay-Discord/os/)

This branch is also used for deploying it to https://mediaplay-discord.github.io/os

## Okay, but will it be an actual OS in the future?
We're not sure about it, but let's see what we will decide later.

Note from Linerly
> Since the Scratch 3 project file can be converted into HTML, it is theoretically possible to turn it into a desktop environment for GNU/Linux (and maybe others?) by either using WebKit in GTK or Chromium in Qt. I haven't seen someone who's making a desktop environment using web technologies though - actually no, Google did it for Chromium/Chrome OS (iirc). Ideas.

## Techy already made MPD OS and it's fine! Why bother making a 'remastered' version?
This remastered version will include more features, including a polished installation wizard,  new UIs, more functionalites, and more to come!

## Can I help?
Although it's being worked on by 3 people - UN4YA, Dimitris Savu, and Linerly - you could help by making new assets and UI designs!

## Why bother using PowerPoint? It's proprietary.
We know about this. One of us had an idea in mind to make it in Scratch - which technically has a lot more features than PowerPoint - but most of us can use PowerPoint or any other program (like LibreOffice Impress, which Linerly uses it) anyway.

## Can I submit ideas?
You can submit by going to the Issues section of this repository, thanks!

## What's with MediaPlay OS and MPD OS?
We decided to change the name of the project since we're not affiliated with Discord or anything.
